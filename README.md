# The Monkees Website by Robert Marshall

This website is built for a band that wishes to promote themselves by giving the visitor information on future dates, tasters of there sound and a video example of there performance abilities.

This website fulfills this across five pages.

## index.html

A landing page to act as a site hub and navigation page using images of album covers and a group head shot to introduce the band and there image to the site visitor.

## meet.html

This page offers an opportunity to read a little about each of the band members. The information was taken from and links to their respective wikipedia pages.

## listen.html

The listen page offers an opportunity to hear some of the bands most popular songs. Using the html ** audio ** element and including two different file types (ogg and mpeg). I placed the ** ogg **
files first as according to some documentation these have superior sound quality, the ** mpeg ** file is then included to maintain cross browser compatibility.

## watch.html

This page showcases one of the bands music videos.

## book.html

On this page the site visitor can see upcoming dates and also follow a link to a site where tickets can be purchased.

# Functionality

This site utilises bootstrap and its grid system to help with the layout and mobile responsiveness aswell as using the navbar-collapse utility for mobile screens.

My own further styling has been done with css in the file named ** style.css **.
